    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup warm water</li>
    <li>½ cup yellow cornmeal</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>¼ pound spicy Italian sausage, cooked</li>
    <li>9 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>⅓ cup diced pepperoni</li>

    <li>3 cloves garlic, sliced</li></ul>
<ol type="I"><h1>Instructions</h1>    
    <li><em>To Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in 1 cup warm water; in a separate small bowl combine the yeast, 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 cup warm water. Mix together and let rest in bowl for about 20 minutes, until foamy.</em></li>
    <div></div>
    <li><em>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl mix together remaining 2 1/2 cups flour with cornmeal and salt; remove half of this mixture from bowl and stir 1 cup sugar water into bowl. When well mixed, return second half of flour/cornmeal mixture to bowl and mix all together; then stir in yeast mixture. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 12 minutes. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume.</em></li>
    <div></div>
    <li><em>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). To Make Stuffing: In a large bowl combine the sausage, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, oregano and garlic. Mix well.</em></li>
    <div></div>
    <li><em>Press half of the dough in the bottom and up the sides of a lightly greased deep dish pan. Bake crust in preheated oven for 4 minutes, then add the stuffing mixture to the bottom crust and cover with top crust; seal edges together with fingers, and trim excess. Slit top crust to allow steam to vent during baking; top with tomato sauce.</em></li>
    <li><em>Bake on lower rack at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes, then cut and serve.</em></li></ol>
